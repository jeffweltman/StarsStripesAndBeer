# Stars, Stripes, and Beer - README.md
Jeff Weltman and Claudia Woodruff

## Project Description
W&W Analytics has been commissioned by *Stars, Stripes, and Beer Co.* - hereafter referred to as *SS&B* - to analyze a sample of the craft beer market in order to answer the following research questions:

* How many breweries are present in each state?
* What is the median alcohol content (ABV) for each state? What is the median international bitterness unit (IBU) for each state?
* Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
* Is there any apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content

  ## FAQs
  ### Where did this data come from?
  *These data were collected from the public domain across a variety of sources, including *ratebeer.com*, the craft breweries' websites, and social media.*
  
  ### I especially loved (insert plot/section here). Which one of you is responsible for this?
  This project for *SS&B* was a truly collaborative endeavor. Both Claudia and Jeff applied their expertise to the research questions, data files, and code. The Codebook and this Readme have been prepared largely by Jeff. The final presentation document was almost exclusively Claudia's masterpiece.
  
  ### This is exceptional work! Can I contact W&W Analytics regarding other projects?
  *We would love to hear from you! Thank you for your interest.*
